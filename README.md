# CIFAR-10 Image Classification using MobileNetV2

This project implements image classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset using
transfer learning with MobileNetV2 in TensorFlow/Keras.

## Features
- Transfer learning with ImageNet weights
- Two-phase training (freeze + fine-tune)
- Model checkpointing
- Clean project structure for production use
